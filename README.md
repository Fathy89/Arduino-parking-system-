# Arduino-parking-system
This project is meant to  make parking process atomically and easy with using some sensors with Arduino board  like ultra_sonic , ir sensor and ldr . The code is written in C++ and can be easily modified to suit your needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites 
To use this project, you will need the following:

<ul>
  <li>An Arduino board (such as the Uno or Nano)</li>
