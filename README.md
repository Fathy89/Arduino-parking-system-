# Arduino-parking-system
This project is meant to  make parking process atomically and easy with using some sensors with Arduino board  like ultra_sonic , ir sensor and ldr . The code is written in C++ and can be easily modified to suit your needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites 
To use this project, you will need the following:


  - An Arduino board (such as the Uno or Nano)
  - Jumper Wires
  - LCD (16*2 or I2c)
  - Ir Sensor
  - ultrasonic Sensor
  - Ldr
  - Servo Motor
  - Leds
  - Resistors
  - Potentiometer (if you will use the 16*2 lcd) 
  - A computer with the Arduino IDE installed
  - Bread board 
### Installing

1. Connect the Sensor , Lcd  and Servo Motor  to the Arduino board. Refer to the schematic in the "schematic.png" file for the pinout.

2. Open the "parkingsys.ino" file in the Arduino IDE.

3. Upload the code to the Arduino board.
