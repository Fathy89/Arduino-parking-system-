# Arduino-parking-system
This project is meant to  make parking process atomically and easy with using some sensors with Arduino board  like ultra_sonic , ir sensor and ldr . The code is written in C++ and can be easily modified to suit your needs.

## Getting Started

<h5>Prerequisites </h5>
To use this project, you will need the following:

<ul>
  <li>An Arduino board (such as the Uno or Nano)</li>
  <li>Jumper Wires</li>

  <li>Ir Sensor</li>
  <li>ultrasonic Sensor</li>
  <li>Ldr</li>
  <li>Servo Motor</li>
  <li>Leds</li>
  <li>Rsistors</li>
  <li>potentiometer (if you will use the 16*2 lcd) </li>
  <li>bread board </li>
  <il>A computer with the Arduino IDE installed</il>
</ul>
